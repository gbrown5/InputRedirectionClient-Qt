Input redirection client for the 3DS using QtGamepad redesigned for Android.

  Supported platforms:

    Optimized for :
    * Android (4.1 and above via InputDevice API)

    Non-optimized for (but also work) :
    * Windows (via xinput, if you don't have a Xbox controller you should use x360ce)
    * Linux (via evdev)
    * OSX
    * maybe others?

If you have multiple controllers connected at the same time, this software will combine their inputs.
